#GraphQL

- GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.
- It provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API
- This allows clients to request exactly the data they need, and nothing more, making your API faster, more efficient, and easier to use
- GraphQL was developed by Facebook to optimize RESTful API calls

\*\* Disadvantages of REST API

- Over fetching :- Getting back more data than we need
- Under fetching:- Getting back less data than we need
